# BG Generator

This app was mostly started as an internal tool used to generate a creative
background image for my personal website. I've decided to make it publicly
available since it could have other interesting uses.

The app is written using Svelte+SvelteKit, and utilizes many of Svelte's core
features like stores, slots, binding, etc.

[See the app online](https://projects.calebevans.me/bg-generator/)

## Setup

### Installing

This project uses [pnpm][pnpm] (instead of npm) for package installation and
management.

[pnpm]: https://pnpm.io/

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
pnpm install
```

### Serving the app

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The app will then be viewable in your browser at http://localhost:5173.
